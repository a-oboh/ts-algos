# Data Structures & Algorithms using Typescript

This repository contains implementations of some of the most Data structures and algorithms in typescript, useful for interview preparations, personal interest and anything in-between.

<!-- ### Topics -->

### Complexity analysis
- Big O
- Time & space complexity

### Data Structures
- Arrays
- Hash Tables
- Singly Linked List
- Doubly Linked List
- Trees
- Stacks
- Queues (WIP)
- Graphs (WIP)

### Algorithms
- **WIP**

### Patterns
- **WIP**

### Setting up
- You'd need to have `node js` installed
- Install Typescript globally via npm `npm install -g typescript`
- Clone repo and install dependencies `npm install`
- Run files separately
