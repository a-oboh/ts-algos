# Data Structures & Algorithms with Typescript

This repository contains implementations of some of the most common Data structures and algorithms with typescript, useful for interview preparations, personal interest and anything in-between.

## Topics

### Complexity analysis

- Big O
- Time & space complexity

### Data Structures

- Arrays
- Hash Tables
- Singly Linked List
- Doubly Linked List
- Trees
- Stacks
- Queues
- Graphs (WIP)

### Algorithms (WIP)

- Recursion
- Sorting
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick sort
- Searching
  - Linear Search
  - Breadth First Search (BFS)

### Problem Solving Patterns

- **WIP**

### Setting up

- You'd need to have `node js` installed
- Install Typescript globally via npm `npm install -g typescript`
- Clone repo and install dependencies `npm install`
- Run files individually e.g `nodemon src/algorithms/sorting/merge-sort/merge_sort.ts`
